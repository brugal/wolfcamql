* bug fix:   team overlay information wasn't updating correctly with protocol 91 demos
* cg_useDemoZoom 2  resets zoom settings at round start in clan arena to work around a quake live bug where the fov values from the previously viewed player are still being used
* bug fix:  cg_forcePovModel didn't check model for "tag_flag"
* cg_enemyHeadModel
* cg_teamHeadModel
* headmodel support with cg_forcePovModel
* bug fix:  blacklisted team model wasn't reset correctly if own model changed

* cg_disallowEnemyModelForTeammates 1 also changes pov model.  Setting to 2 is the old behavior that only changes the model if the player was a teammate (not including self).
* bug fix:  wrong icon for world kill/death
* bug fix:  team skins used in non-team games

* cg_fovStyle 2 added.  This should match quakelive.  This is similar to 1 but uses fixed aspect ratios (5:4, 4:3, 16:10, and 16:9).  Vertical fov is preserved and more of the horizontal view is shown as the screen width increases and passes through each aspect threshold.  This stretches the ingame world view to match the highest apsect ratio matched and has an upper limit of 16:9.
* cg_fovForceAspectWidth and cg_fovForceAspectHeight  with cg_fovStyle 1 or 2 this forces fov calculations to this apsect ratio and then stretches the ingame world view to match the screen width.
* bug fix:  free spec was using third person view offset
* cg_specOffsetQL (0:  use first person view like quake3, 1 (default):  no adjustment like quakelive, 2:  use third person offsets)

* cl_demoFileCheckSystem  check for demo file in the local file system as well as wolfcam and quake live directories.  (0:  no check,  1:  check local directory before wolfcam or quakelive directories, 2:  (default) check if not found in wolfcam or quake live directories)

  ex:  wolfcamql.exe +set cl_demoFileCheckSystem 1 +demo c:\tmp\dem6.dm_90

* bug fix:  map items incorrectly registered
* bug fix:  cgame map entity checking accepts string values for "not_gametype" like quake live

* bug fix:  /devmap and /map entity parsing accept "duel" gametype as well as "tournament"
* bug fix:  demo protocol wasn't being checked before the first demo packet was handled
* bug fix:  cgame map entity parsing accepts "duel" as gametype as well as "tournament".  This could result in invalid items being used for item timers.

* bug fix:  crash creating player name sprites if font is invalid
* bug fix:  crash if font image data was bigger than 256x256
* bug fix:  invalid value for apos.gravity in dm 73 entityState
* bug fix:  incorrect parsing of spawn variables in cgame if there was only one gametype listed in the map
* bug fix:  spawn variables accept 'tdm' as team deathmatch name as well as 'team'
* fx:  player[legs|torso|head] copy current axis values to script variables which can be uses with 'axismodel'
* fx bug fix:  player[legs|torso|head]/trail was sharing interval and position data with player weapon flash and impacts
* fx:  'animFrame' variable added to control model animations, player/[legs|torso|head]/trail automatically set this from current player animation
* fx bug fix:  incorrect parsing of variables in 'command'
* fx bug fix:  memory corruption if 'command' string was longer than 64 bytes
* bug fix:  crash if surface entity reference invalid (seen with overload map)

* support for quake live update Aug 27, 2014

* support for demo protocol 91
  - cg_useDemoFov  protocol 91 transmits player fov values and this can be used to view the demo using the players fov or to try and detect zoom changes.  Note that zoom isn't transmitted in the demo so it is detected using a fov change.  This will lead to a problem if the player uses a config that changes fov (ex:  per weapon).  Values (0:  ignore demo fov (default),  1:  use player's fov,  2:  detect zoom changes).
  - new steam paks
  - removed ownerdraws available in ui/wcmenudef.h (CG_SERVER_OWNER, CG_1ST_PLYR_FULLCLAN, CG_2ND_PLYR_FULLCLAN, UI_SERVER_OWNER)
  - steam ids shown with /players command
  - utf8 support (FIXME bitmap/q3 font/console 0 width code points)

      To enter unicode characters into the console type 'x' plus the hex value and then press 'ctrl + tab' or 'ctrl + keypad_insert'.

  - r_debugFonts (0:  (default) no information, 1:  show missing glyphs,  2:  show font fallback checks, 3:  show all glyph loading)
  - font fallbacks:

      First the fonts included with quakelive are added to the font fallback list (notosans-regular.ttf and droidsansfallbackfull.ttf).  This can be enabled/disabled with r_defaultQlFontFallbacks.

      User set fonts are then added to the list.  These are specified as r_fallbackFont[number] (ex:  r_fallbackFont1, r_fallbackFont2, etc.).  If the cvar doesn't exist or is empty processing stops.

      Default Microsoft fonts (l_10646.ttf, segoeui.ttf, and arialuni.ttf)  are loaded from wolfcam's 'font' directory (either in base installation or application data directory).  These are the defaults used by quakelive and it lets non-Windows users have the same fallbacks by simply copying the fonts over.  This can be enabled/disabled with r_defaultMSFontFallbacks.

      System fonts are added for Windows users.  These are the same MS fonts listed above.  This can be enabled/disabled with r_defaultSystemFontFallbacks.

      GNU Unifonts are used as the final fallbacks.  This can be enabled/disabled with r_defaultUnifontFallbakcs.

  - fs_searchWorkshops (0: don't use steam workshop pk3s,  1: (default) load extra pk3s referenced in demos from steam workshop directories).  This checks both the steam directory and wolfcamql {APPLICATION DATA}/workshop.

    Workshops referenced in demo can be checked in the +info screen and with the com_workshopids cvar.

  - cl_downloadWorkshops  to auto download workshop items into wolfcamql workshop folder.  This uses steamcmd (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) which needs to be in your executable search path or it can be specified with fs_steamcmd.

* r_mode default changed to 11  (856x480)
* steam quake live directory also checked for demos
* fs_quakelivedir changed to also support steam version and needs to point to the parent of the 'baseq3' directory.  Ex:  wolfcamql +set fs_quakelivedir "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Quake Live\\12345678901234567"

------------------------------------
10.3  2013-11-16

* documentation note about q3mme fx incompatibility introduced in the last couple of releases:

   In wolfcam scripting for an emitted entity stops once it has been added, so 'impact', 'distance', and 'interval' scripts need to come before 'sprite', 'model', and other rendering directives.

   see README-wolfcam.txt for more information

   sample q3mme.fx changed to match that (2 changes to the gibbed scripts)

* cg_drawHitFriendTime  (same as quake live)
* cl_keepDemoFileInMemory  to enable or disable completely loading the demo at the start of demo playback  (1 (default) for performance improvements while rewinding and fastforwading, 0 for demos that aren't completely saved yet)
* 'clear' option for /clientoverride can also be followed by 'red', 'blue', 'enemy', 'mates', 'us', 'all', or a client number.  The default is 'all'.
* removed console spamming with /clientoverride
* hud scripting bug fix:  wrong precedence order for and/or (& |)

------------------------------------
10.2  2013-08-23

* WCG_KILL_COUNT hud element and /killcountreset command
* cg_demoSmoothing expanded:

    1:  Look ahead in the demo to see if there are sequential snapshots where
        you have some type of velocity in both snapshots but your origin
        hasn't changed.  That means the server hasn't gotten around to playing
        the packets you sent, which will make demo playback jerky.  A cyan bar
        will be drawn in the lagometer whenever this happens.  Applies to demo
        pov as well as other players.
    2:  Smooth demo taker's pov using current and next snapshots (quake3
        default behavior is to just use the current snapshot origin and
        angles without smoothing).
    values higher than 2:  Skip this number of snapshots when smoothing.  The
        higher the value the more robotic and unnatural movement will become.
        Position will become more inaccurate and it's possible to clip through
        walls and trigger other similar bugs.

* cg_demoSmoothingAngles [0:  don't smooth view angles when using cg_demoSmoothing]
* cg_demoSmoothingTeleportCheck [0:  always transition player position when using cg_demoSmoothing]
* bug fix:  possible crash and memory corruption when looking ahead in demo
* keep demo file in memory to avoid disk usage when rewinding and fast forwarding
* bug fix:  last update disabled freezetag frozen teammate icon and flag carrier icons
* cl_maxRewindBackups  Number of seek points to divide the demo into.  The higher, the more response fast forwarding and rewinding becomes.  Note that each backup point will require about 1.7MB .  The default is 12.
* ioquake3 fixes

* bug fix:  camera code could set wrong sound entity for first person view resulting in first person view sounds being played at half volume
* s_showMiss  debug cvar to show skipped sounds (1:  skipped because of max repeat rate, 2: also show if it was skipped because of max number of sounds being played, >2:  show if sound channel couldn't be allocated)

* fx:  lightning gun impact fps independent  cg_fxLightningGunImpactFps  (default is 125, 0 to disable)
* player model scaling and server set models:
    cg_playerModelAutoScaleHeight  scale player models to match this height (default: 57, "" to disable)

    these are used after auto scaling pass:

  ex: /runfx changefov

    // fx version of '/cvarinterp cg_fov 0 110 10'
    changeFov {
        t0  cg_fov
        emitterf 10 {
            if lerp >= 1.0 {  // last call cleanup, set cg_fov to orig value
                command cg_fov %t0
                return  // all done
            }
            //echo lerp
            t1 t0 * lerp
            command cg_fov %t1

* cg_demoStepSmoothing  (move up steps smoothly instead of stuttering up and down during demo playback the same as is done when playing the game)
* cg_stepSmoothTime  default is 100 (similar to quakelive)  which will usually bounce up and down when crouching and going up steps.  quake3 default is 200 where even crouch will cause you to move up stairs in a straight line
* cg_stepSmoothMaxChange
* higher precision for 'curve' camera type (floating point overflows with low timescales)
* bug fix:  cg_drawAttackerTime wasn't being used
* cg_zoomBroken  ql/q3 have weird zooming behavior where if you release zoom key early it wont zoom back down from the zoom fov you had reached, instead it will switch to full zoom fov and back down from there.  Can look as if zoom key is stuck with low timescales.
* cg_zoomIgnoreTimescale
* cg_zoomTime  how quickly, in milliseconds, to zoom in and out
* allow +zoom when using /follow

   match, if possible, the final immediate velocity of a camera point to the
   immediate initial velocity of the next camera point to have smooth origin
   transitions  (done by setting the appropriate overall final and initial
   velocities)
* /ecam smooth angles
  (same as '/ecam smooth origin' for view angles)
* /ecam smooth originf
  aggresive origin smoothing which will change origins and camera times in
  order to match velocities
* /ecam smooth anglesf
  aggresive angles smoothing which will change angles (but not times) in order
  to match angle velocities
* cg_cameraSmoothFactor (value between 1.0 and 2.0) used by /ecam smooth <type>
* bug fix fx: don't run weapon/flash script twice for 1st person view
* new tiered armor hud support
* use correct thaw tick sound in freezetag
* switching to freecam doesn't change your origin.  use /freecam 0 0 26   or  /freecam offset 0 0 26   for old behavior of switching to third person above the player model
* /freecam accepts [offset | set | move | last] as a first argument (with offset being the default)
   ex:  /freecam move 100   whill switch to third person 100 game units ahead of player
        /freecam last   switch to third person and use last freecam position
* /setviewangles
* /moveoffset same as move but using xyz coordinates
* /move command changes positions/angles relative to where you already are:  /move [forward amount] [right] [up] [pitch] [yaw] [roll]

* com_execVerbose  default 0 to avoid spamming console when you execute a cfg file
* ql shader parameter 'novlcollapse'  (used with r_vertexLight 1)
* cg_noTaunt
* r_fastsky 2  won't disable portal views
* r_showtris and r_showNormals set to 2 won't have wallhack effect
* r_debugMarkSurface  when set to 1 will print the name of the map shader upon which impact marks are drawn
* r_ignoreNoMarks   allows marks on surfaces that have been set to not have marks on them.  Mostly for use with r_debugMarkSurface but can be used if you want to have extra impact marks (lamps, etc..).

  1:  allow extra impact marks except on water, slime, fog, and lava
  2:  allow even on liquids and fog (if possible)

* dynamically change shaders with  /remapshader <old shader> <new shader> [time offset -- usually 0]  [keepLightmap from first shader -- 0: no 1: yes (default)]

  ex:  /remapshader textures/gothic_floor/metalbridge02 textures/gothic_floor/largerblock3b4


  /listremappedshaders
  /clearremappedshader <shader name>
  /clearallremappedshaders

  also, as a convenience:  /remaplasttwoshaders  which remaps the last two uniquely named shaders

    ex:  'bind h /remaplasttwoshaders'  shoot surface with shader you want, shoot surface you want to change, hit 'h'  (maps 0 to 1 in console)

* bug fix:  crash with /devmap and r_vertexLight 1
* camtrace 3d support:

  Add camera points as usual then /camtracesave [old]  will save cameras/ct3d/pos which can be imported into camtrace 3d.  They will be exported as et:qw compatible files unless the 'old' option is used.  'old' option writes etpro compatible files which can be imported into camtrace as obviously 'et' type and they can also be used in older versions of camtrace 3d.

  Commands added for compatibility are exec_at_time, g_fov, demo_scale, freecamlookatplayer [num], freecamsetpos

* stop video recording before finishing 'disconnect' or 'quit'

* eliminated mme_workMegs, will allocate memory based on video settings
* removed limit of 32 for mme_blurFrames and mme_blurOverlap
* fx:  improved compatability with q3mme, eliminated some timescale and fps dependencies, cg_fxScriptMinEmitter, cg_fxScriptMinDistance, cg_fxScriptMinInterval  (see readme)
* fx bug:  trig functions where using radians instead of degrees.  If you have a script where you like the current behavior you can change:
  cos(someValue)  to  cos(someValue * 180.0 / PI) and it will continue working the same way.
* fx:  t? and v? expanded up to 9
* fx:  some debugging options (see readme)
* cg_autoWriteConfig (0: don't automatically write q3config.cfg when a cvar changes (can be useful for testing configs), 1:  always write q3config.cfg when a cvar changes, 2:  (default) don't write q3config.cfg if a cvar is changed from fx scripting code or with /cvarinterp to prevent hard disk thrashing)
* map autoxec:  maps/campgrounds.cfg, maps/lostworld.cfg, etc...
* fx:  impact scripts have the reflected impact velocity in 'velocity', see scripts/dirtest.fx  (red stuff is reflected velocity, blue is 'dir' or face plane)
* proximity mines leave explosion marks on walls and not just floors
* cg_adShaderOverride  when set to 1 you can use cg_adShader[num] to replace the ad.  It needs to be the name of a shader:
  ex:  create a file name scripts/mycustomads.shader  with the following:

  myad1 {
    nopicmip
    {
      map somePic.jpg
    }
  }

  Then 'set cg_adShader3 myad1' will replace the 3rd map ad with your custom pic.
  You can use /devamp somemap  and then /gotoad [ad number]  to find how they are numbered.
* fx bug:  common impactFlesh wasn't being called by machine gun hits
* fx bug:  'dir' for lg impact was using the wrong vector
* don't spam console when recording video

* cg_playerShader to add a non wall hacked shader (can be used in combination with cg_whShader to make it easier to see when someone becomes visible)
* cg_wideScreen  0: original code  1: don't adjust values to 4/3 aspect ratio  2: adjust both y and x values based on only the x ratio (a bit of a hack to allow already created configs)

  This isn't perfect as there are still some hard coded values assuming 4/3 aspect within the source code, but it should work well for movie configs to prevent stretching of the crosshair and text.
* support for q3mme fx 'shaderlist'
* cg_freecam_unlockPitch
* r_anaglyphMode fixed
* r_anaglyph2d to allow or prevent splitting colors for the hud portion

* renamed cl_enableAtCommands to cg_enableAtCommands
* /at command with higher than millisecond precision
* q3 bug fix for skies without cloud shaders which can lead to texture corruption (ex: toxicity map)
* cg_screenDamageAlpha_Self
  (note: was controlled previously by cg_screenDamageAlpha, so if you had screen damage enabled you would have black marks on the screen for self damage and with bloom turned on it would look like bloom was briefly being disabled)

* /cvarinterp /clearcvarinterp  to gradualy change the value of a cvar
  ex:  /cvarinterp s_volume 0 0.7 6.0
       raises s_volume from 0 to 0.7 in 6 seconds
* cg_fadeColor, cg_fadeAlpha  for screen fading in/out
* cg_fadeStyle  (0:  fade before drawing hud, 1: fade after drawing hud)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
8.2 2011-06-29

* don't draw infinite ammo icon for gauntlet
* /follow crosshair uses specified crosshair color
* added sv_skillrating cvar for huds
* cg_cameraDefaultOriginType  [ curve, spline, interp, jump ]
* can add camera points in between existing ones, also if there's one at the current time /addcamerapoint will edit that point with current settings
* cg_inheritPowerupShader  for multiple powerups (ex: quad and medkit) do/don't apply the first powerup custom shader to the second

* cg_gibColor  for the quake live gib sphere that gets launched (not the same as cg_gibSparksColor which is for the trail)
* better matching for quake live gibs (directional, gravity, and bounce).  See README file for new cvars.  New settings will conflict with old ones so you will probably want to do:

  /reseta cg_gib

 Which will reset all cg_gib* cvars to the new default values, otherwise the new gibs might look weird.

* cg_useDefaultTeamSkins  If you don't have forced team models you can set to 0 and see your teammates chosen skin instead of blue or red.

* fix for square dynamic lighting (ex:  top of mega health jumpad dm6)

  r_dynamicLight 1  fixes square lights, 2 original code, 3 testing only determine if lighting applies in one place in the source code

* fx:  angles fix for models (lightning impact random angles)
* don't clear scene when seeking
* /seekclock can be passed in as a command line option (make sure +demo somedemo.dm_73 comes first)

     /set rDown play sound/weapons/lowammo
     /set rUp echopopup r key up
     /bind r ++vstr 200 rDown rUp

* cg_playerLeanScale  similar to quakelive's cg_playerLean and allows you to select how much leaning the player models do.

* new ql crosshairs
* r_singleShader options and r_singleShaderName  to replace all the map textures

  ex:  +set r_singleShaderName textures/crn_master/smooth_concrete +set r_singleShader 2

  r_singleShader options:  1 replace all textures include advertisements and don't apply lightmap, 2 same as 1 but apply lightmap, 3 replace all map textures except advertisements and don't apply lightmap, 4 same as 3 but apply lightmap

  Along with r_fastSkyColor can be used for chroma keying:

  +set r_singleShaderName wc/map/custom +set r_singleShader 1 +set r_fastSky 1 +set r_fastSkyColor 0x010001

  You can edit or replace wolfcam-ql/gfx/wc/custom.tga to choose the color.

* bug fix, screen was vibrating with pause and really low timescales
* crash fix for vid_restart while paused, also will not stay stuck at loading screen if paused
* r_BloomTextureScale similar to r_BloomBlurScale.  r_BloomBlurFalloff and r_BloomBlurRadius still not implemented, but the following work: r_enableBloom r_BloomPasses r_BloomSceneIntensity r_BloomSceneSaturation r_BloomIntensity r_BloomSaturation r_BloomBrightThreshold
* fx scripting extended:  the following are passed on to the scripting system where appropriate:  team, clientnum, enemy, teammate, ineyes, surfacetype (for impacts).  You could have something like custom rails and rockets per team or different settings for enemies and also first person view.  See wolfcam-ql/scripts/q3mme.fx for more info.

  surfacetype doesn't work that will since the maps only use it occasionaly:
  surfacetype 1 == metal
              2 == wood

* fx scripting extended:  weapon/<weapon name>/impactflesh, also weapon/common/impactflesh
* bug fix, cg_muzzleFlash 0  won't disable muzzle flash in 3rd person for demo taker
* cg_railFromMuzzle default 0  Will always make the rail origin the muzzle point.  It takes into account the different gun positions based on first and third person views and also takes into account any gun position changes made with the cg_gun* cvars.

* /clientoverride similar to q3mme

  /clientoverride <client number or 'red', 'blue', 'enemy', 'all', 'clear'> <key name> <key value> ... with additional key and value pairs as needed

  example:  clientoverride 3 model ranger hmodel bones

  To see what can be changed type /configstrings in the console and scroll up to the player list:

  529: n\WolfPlayer\t\1\model\sarge\hmodel\sarge\c1\5\c2\26\hc\100\w\0\l\0\tt\0\tl\0\rp\0\p\0\so\0\pq\0\cn\\su\0

Also added my email in the documentation if you want to submit bug reports or requests.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7.0 2010-10-10

* added some missing menu pics
* q3mme fx scripting

  /set cg_fxfile "scripts/q3mme.fx"
  /fxload

  to disable ->
  /set cg_fxfile ""
  /fxload

  These two cvars can be used to control performance for now:

  cg_fxinterval  how often in milliseconds the scripting code is run (default 50).  Lowering lowers performance.
  cg_fxratio     ratio of distance and size to determine if script code should be run for an entity (default 0.002).  Lowering lowers performance

  cg_vibrate
  cg_vibrateForce
  cg_vibrateTime
  cg_vibrateMaxDistance

  /fxmath 2 + 4 * 6.1      if you need a calculator or something

  note:  all the scripts need to be in one file

* demo seeking improved speed for larger demos
* cg_weather bug fix (doesn't draw black polygons), also will remove snow on maps like siberia
* can use pause key while using console
* cg_levelTimerDirection added options 3 (always count down and for matches that don't have a timelimit use cg_levelTimerDefaultTimeLimit) and 4 (always count down and try to use the end of game time parsed from the demo, otherwise use cg_levelTimerDefaultTimeLimit)
* bug fix for some corpses not being drawn
* bug fix for random timelimit audio warnings when demo seeking
* can edit crosshair if r_texturebits 32
* /seekclock  takes pregame (warmup) into account
* full freezetag support (round times, team overlay, frozen animations, etc..)

  cg_drawFragMessageThawTokens  same as cg_drawFragMessageTokens  since thawing is considered a type of frag

  cg_drawFriend 1  doesn't have wall hack effect in quakelive's freezetag mode.  I don't know if it's a quakelive bug, but you can use cg_drawFriend 3 to enable it for freezetag

* cg_drawCrosshairTeammateHealth*
* cg_drawCrosshairNames 2  showing only names for teamates, like quakelive
* audio messages taken out of the drawing code so that cg_draw2d 0  doesn't silence them:
  cg_audioAnnouncerRewards, cg_audioAnnouncerRound, cg_audioAnnouncerWarmup, cg_audioAnnouncerVote, cg_audioAnnouncerTeamVote
* ad orientation fix for new maps
* cg_freecam_useServerView  to automatically turn off matching demo taker's screen (cg_useOriginalInterpolation 1) since it's pointless in third person.  Default is 1.
* cg_quadFireSound  to enable/disable the extra sound effect when a player with quad powerup fires their weapon
* fix memory corruption error with bot offline demos
* don't have to raise com_zoneMegs when using large capture screens
* bug fix team overlay powerup icons
* cg_animationsIgnoreTimescale  animations will play in realtime regardless of what timescale setting is.  Default is 0.
* cg_animationsRate  you can speed up (> 1.0) or slow down animations (< 1.0).  Default is 1.0 .
* cg_markTime and cg_markFadeTime  to control wall/floor impact marks
* bug fix for demos that would lock up for a few seconds at the beginning
* bug fix for some demos that couldn't be rewound

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4 2010-09-08

* cl_aviNoAudioHWOutput  don't pass audio data to sound card when recording, default is 1
* capture video at whatever framerate you want, including going past 1000 with or without mme_blurframes

* quad and battle suit dynamic lights matching quakelive's
* new quake3 gib installation instructions so there's no conflict with freezetag snow/ice gibs
* can use wav instead of ogg files for content
* Crash tutorial demo support :\
* cg_spawnArmorTime  new spawn armor shader for spawn protected players, default 500

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.3 2010-08-09

* default timelimit value used if server has set timelimit to 0
* cg_forceMap
  ex:  set cg_forceMap "pro-nodm9"; demo FFA-lostworld.dm_73
* preliminary support for new ql update:  still alot of bugs with freezetag, q3gibs might be temporarily broken because of new freezetag gibs

  If you are only using the newer quake live pk3s old demos will be played back with the new maps.  You can also copy over qz*.pk3 from an older version of quakelive and then a demo will use the same map that it was recorded with.  Note that you should only copy the files that start with qz (ex: qzteam1.pk3, qzdm6.pk3, etc.).  You can also force the use of the older maps with newer demos using cg_forceMap.

* cg_drawSpawnsInitial, cg_drawSpawnsInitialZ, cg_drawSpawnsRespawns, cg_drawSpawnsRespawnsZ, cg_drawSpawnsShared, cg_drawSpawnsSharedZ
* audio recording rate no longer dependent on video framerate, took out ioquake3 audio warning.  Hopefully this fixes the speed up problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2 2010-08-05

* crosshair bug fix with r_texturebits 32
* bug fix for avi files, removing .ivax extension, cl_aviExtension  default "avi"
* cg_railUseOwnColors
* /video avins wav
  to create a video file without sound and a wav file
* q3mme motion blur:  mme_blurFrames, mme_blurType, mme_blurOverlap, mme_workMegs
  The actual rendering rate will be cl_aviFrameRate * mme_blurFrames, so try to make that total a factor of 1000 so that it doesn't screw up playback speed.

------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1 2010-07-31

* fix crash during timeouts
* camera: angles use previous was grabbing angles and not lastAngles
* r_lightmapColor to tint the lightmap
  extreme example:  r_lightmapColor "0xff0000" to make all the lights red
  better example: r_lightmapcolor "0xffafaf" to turn down blue and green a bit,  without completely eliminating them
* fixed problem with handling ql pk3 files, shouldn't take 30 seconds to load cgame
* opendml large avi support  cl_aviAllowLargeFiles 1 (default)
  Allows up to 500+ gigabyte avi

       set cg_weaponDefault "cg_fov 110; cg_drawCrosshair 4"
* /video [avi, tga, jpg, wav, name <file basename>]
  All files stored in video/

  ex:  /video tga wav    to dump tga screenshots and a wav sound recording

* r_jpegCompressionQuality 90 (default)  for screenshots, jpg video dump, and cl_aviMotionJpeg
* cl_aviFetchMode GL_RGB (default switched from ioquake3 GL_RGBA default)

  added default bind:
     bind i "toggle cl_avifetchmode gl_rgb gl_rgba gl_bgr gl_bgra; echopopupcva
r cl_avifetchmode"

  Do a test run and try the different values to see if you can get a performance boost when rendering.

* /playpath fix for having to have a smoothing value

-----------------------------------------------------------------
5.4 2010-07-11

* freecam +rollright +rollleft /centerroll (like /centerview) +rollstopzero
  These change screen tilt.  You can use +rollstopzero in order to recenter it smoothly while using +rollright or +rollleft.  defaults:
      bind e "+rollright"
      bind q "+rollleft"
      bind f "+rollstopzero"
      bind 3 "centerroll"
* tdm bug fix wasn't drawing enemy models
* missile smoke trail fix when using delagging interp  (cg_useOriginalInterpolation)
* reset times for a few things when rewinding/fastforwarding and pausing (frag message staying on screen, crosshair names not fading)
* draw entities (players, missiles, items, etc.) when paused and then rewinding or fastforwarding
* don't exit program when you try to set a video mode your card or monitor don't support, fall back to safe values.  This is in case you try to exec a config that you've downloaded or gotten from someone else.  If a vid mode change fails these get reset to default: r_mode, r_fullscreen, r_colorbits, r_depthbits, r_stencilbits, r_ext_multisample, r_stereoEnabled
* /recordpath and /playpath fixes   /playpath accepts a "smoothing" value.  Ex:
 /playpath 4   will skip every 4 entries in the recorded path and interpolate angles and positions between those
* r_roundimagesdown 0   bug fix
* cg_demoSmoothing   I'm not a fan of this kind of stuff, but I had to include something since alot of the servers have lag problems.  It doesn't smooth the entire demo, it only kicks in when you basically got screwed by the server (assuming you aren't deliberately lagging).  It looks ahead in the demo to see if there are sequential snapshots where you have some type of velocity in both snapshots but your origin hasn't changed.  That means the server hasn't gotten around to playing the packets you sent, which will make demo playback jerky.  A cyan bar will be drawn in the lagometer whenver this happens.
* you don't have to have r_fullscreen 1  in order to use r_overbrightbits
* r_mapOverBrightBitsValue  r_overBrightBitsValue  as alternatives to r_mapOverBrightBits and r_overBrightBits

  I'll try to explain a bit what r_mapOverBrightBits and r_overBrightBits do:

  Both will multiply the colors of a texture by a power of 2, with r_overBrightBits using gamma ramp.  So r_mapOverBrightBits 0  will multiply the colors 2^0 == 1, doesn't change them at all.  r_mapOverBrightBits 1 will multiply by 2^1 == 2, r_mapOverBrightBits 2 will multiply by 2^2 == 4, r_mapOverBrightBits 3 will multiply by 2^3 == 8.

  Multiplying by powers of two doesn't offer very much control.  Personaly I find r_mapOverBrightBits 2 (multiply by 4) to be a little dark, but with r_mapOverBrightBits 3 (multipy by 8) you basically obliterate all the light sources in the map since textures are as bright as they could possibly be.  Set r_mapOverBrightBits to 0 and then use r_mapOverBrightBitsValue to multiply it by whatever number you want.

  Incidentally r_mapOverBrightBits will preserve color.  It won't keep brightening until things will become white (unlike, i think, r_intensity), so if one of the color components (red green blue) hits the max value of 255 it doesn't brighten anymore.

  r_overBrightBits like I mentioned before applies gamma correction and it will distort colors. One of the limitations of quake3/ioquake3/etc is that gamma correction depends on r_ignorehwgamma being set to 0.

* F1  hard coded as an additional toggle for the console
* teamoverlay bug fix (the first player in the list was drawn offscreen)
* cg_drawRewards: 1   (default) draw reward count to the right of icon, 2: draw reward count below icon like quake3
* /viewunlockyaw   /viewunlockpitch

  Ex:  use /viewunlockpitch if you want to view someone strafe jumping and not have the view bounce up and down.

* /gotoview  added additonal options:  /gotoview [forward] [right] [up] [force] relative to the viewed entity.  The force (integer) option means to jump to the view even if you might get stuck inside a wall.
* /view  added options:  /view <entNum> [x offset] [y offset] [z offset]     [] means optional
* /chase <entNum> [x offset] [y offset] [z offset]     [] means optional


---------------------------------------------------------------
5.3 2010-07-03

* black text/models in windows bug fix, linux atoi() automatically converts hex, check for hex in cvar.c
* screen will update while paused and rewinding or fast forwarding
* cg_drawPlayerNames fixed
* cg_drawEntNumbers  will draw the entity numbers above everything so you can easily id something like a rocket or grenade and then use /view <num> to lock the view onto it
* /view here to lock view at the place you are
* /playpath fixes (getting stuck and playing too fast)
* sound origin set to camera origin (was previously still on demo taker)
* cg_freecam_useTeamSettings 1   to set demo takers skin/model to match teamates
* freecam don't switch off hud if demo taker dies
* ctf different colors for team spawns with cg_drawSpawns
* colorize cpma/ql rail rings inside core (I'd assumed it was always white), cg_railQLRailRingWhiteValue can still be used to control brightness
* enemy/team skin fix to check when the cvars were set to ""
* bright/color skins fix to work with r_vertexlight 1  again

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 2010-06-24
* fix bug with /playpath that caused it to get un-synced when recording video
* s_useopenal default is 0
* echopopup can be used if cg_draw2d 0

---------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 2010-06-23

* added note to documentation that it's based on ioquake3 and you have the ability to record videos:

   cl_aviFrameRate                   - the framerate to use when capturing video
   cl_aviMotionJpeg                  - use the mjpeg codec when capturing video

 New commands
   video [filename]        - start video capture
   stopvideo               - stop video capture

* since freecaming while rendering is awkward (fps drop) I included a temporary fix until I work on the camera stuff:  /recordpath, issue the command again to stop recording and then /playpath to playback the movements that you made
* command /cvarsearch <string> to find any cvar containg the string.  Ex:  /cvarsearch rail  will show the cg_rail* cvars as well as r_rail*
* cg_crosshairHitStyle 0-8 like quake live
* cg_crosshairHitTime, cg_crosshairHitColor
* cg_crosshairPulse same as quake live
* cg_crosshairAlpha
* cg_crosshairAlphaAdjust to adjust the transparent portions of crosshairs.  cg_crosshairAlphaAdjust > 0 will make them more visible, less than 0 will make them even more transparent
* cg_crosshairBrightness values 0.0 -> 1.0 work the same as quake live (essentialy making it more like crosshair darkness).  Values greater than 1.0 will actually make it brighter.  The values above 1.0 will shift that integer amount of the pixels towards white.  cg_crosshairBrightness 255 will make all the original pixels white.
* font, scale, etc. options for all q3hud elements:
  cg_drawTeamOverlay*, cg_drawAttacker*, cg_lagometer*, cg_drawSpeed*, cg_drawOrigin*, cg_drawItemPickups*, cg_drawFollowing*, cg_weaponBar*, cg_drawVote*, cg_drawWaitingForPlayers*, cg_drawWarmupString*, cg_drawCrosshairNames*, cg_drawAmmoWarning*, cg_drawSnapshot*, cg_drawPlayerNames*, cg_drawFPS*,

  Ex: cg_drawFpsAlpha, cg_drawFpsColor, cg_drawFpsScale, cg_drawFpsPointSize, cg_drawFpsFont, cg_drawFpsStyle, cg_drawFpsAlign, cg_drawFpsX, cg_drawFpsY, cg_drawFpsNoText (just shows the number)

* cg_lightningShaft options same as quake live
* cg_ligntingImpact
* fixed a rewind/ff/seek bug where the demo taker's torso was twisted
* color cvars now use hex
* most wolfcam_* cvars changed to cg_
* in addition to cg_enemyModel and cg_teamModel you can override the skins with cg_enemyHeadSkin, cg_enemyTorsoSkin, cg_enemyLegsSkin.
  Ex:  set cg_enemyModel "keel/bright"  and then set cg_enemyLegsSkin "xaero/color" to use xaero's pants.  See below why the feature was included.
* cg_enemyRailColor1, cg_enemyRailColor2, cg_enemyRailColor1Team and cg_enemyRailColor2Team can be used to set the rail colors to whatever team color they are
* cg_enemyRailItemColor  (cg_teamRailItemColor) the color of the actual gun they hold, default is "" which uses whatever the player's color1 is.
* cg_enemyRailRings (cg_teamRailRings) if you want the enemies to have rail rings
* cg_enemyRailNudge and cg_teamRailNudge
* color skins for all models, they are generated automatically from the already available red and blue skins you can use r_colorSkinsFuzz (the amount that a diff between red and blue skins will signal a match and not replace with white: default 20)  and r_colorSkinsIntensity (default 1.0)  and the /createcolorskins vid_restart to tweak them.  You can then use skin overrides to allow either team or enemies to keep their models but use colorized skins:    ex:  set cg_enemyModel "", then cg_enemyHeadSkin "color", cg_enemyTorsoSkin "color", cg_enemyLegsSkin "color", same for team
* cg_railQL 1 to use quakelive rail core with rail rings interspersed, cg_railQLRailRingWhiteValue to control the white value of the rings.
* cg_railRadius cg_railRotation cg_railSpacing to control spiral rails
* eliminated cg_oldRail, so that you can un-nudge.  You can use cg_railNudge even for rails that don't have rings.  By "un-nudge" I mean that q3 and ql shift the rail below the crosshair for most rail styles (try shooting rails at a wall and you'll see the impact mark below your crosshair).  Use cg_railNudge 0 to have your rails go through your crosshair.
* cg_railItemColor for the railguns that spawn or are dropped by players
* command /fragforward [optional pre kill time ms] [optional death hover time ms]
* /ccopy <var> <new cvar>
* /reseta cg_drawAttacker  to reset cg_drawAttacker* to defaults
* demo looping  /setloopstart /setloopend /loop to start stop, or /loop <servertime start> <servertime stop>.  Check with /servertime command
* can use scoreboard while freecaming
* cg_scoreBoardWhenDead
* cg_scoreBoardAtIntermission
* tokenized frag and obituary messages: cg_drawFragMessageTokens "You fragged %v"   cg_obituaryTokens "%k %i %v".  Available tokens:
  %v  victim name
  %V  victim name with color escapes removed
  %k  killer name
  %K  killer name with color escapes removed
  %q  old q3 frag message ("player ate player2's rocket")
  %w  weapon name  ("Railgun, Rocket Launcher", etc..)
  %i  weapon icon
  %A  per kill total accuracy (all weapons)  (killer)
  %a  per kill accuracy of kill weapon (killer)
  %D  per kill total accuracy (all weapons) (victim)
  %d  per kill total accuracy of last held weapon (victim)
  %c  hex color code  ex:  %c0xff00ff  you can also use the usual color codes: ^3
  %t  victim's team color
  %T  killer's team color
  %f  victim's flag in team games
  %F  killer's flag in team games

  For lightning gun whores try:  cg_drawFragMessageSeparate 1, cg_drawFragMessageTokens "You fragged %v %a"
* you can switch fonts in hud configs, "font" keyword added  ex:

        itemDef {
        name "a"
        rect 16 5 63 12
        visible 1
        textstyle 3
        decoration
        textscale .45
        forecolor 1 1 1 1
        ownerdraw CG_PLAYER_AMMO_VALUE
        addColorRange 6 999 1 .75 0 1
        //font "fontsextra/times.ttf" 48
        font "q3small" 48
        }

* cg_weather 0  to eliminate rain on t7
* fixed some bad interpolation bugs, playback should be much smoother
* ql and q3 gibs can be toggled, no need to move files around, see new directions in README-wolfcam.txt, also fixes bug where q3 files disabled ql screendamge settings
* ca keep track of obituary messages and updates scoreboard accordingly
* cg_drawPlayerNames
* freecam /stopmovement since there's no gravity friction
* freecam /view <entity num> to lock view  /listentities
* freecam /gotoview to jump to the entity (or demo taker)
* q3fonts available as "q3tiny", "q3small", "q3big", "q3giant"

------------------------------------------------------------------
5.0  2010-05-31

* from last release which I forgot to mention cadd <cvar> <value>  to add <value> to <cvar>, also csub, cmul, cdiv
* as a convenience /loadhud  can accept an arg so you don't have to set cg_hudfiles.   Ex:  /loadhud somehud.cfg
* libfreetype2 font support, fonts can be set in your hud config and need to have a .ttf extension.  Try to avoid putting them in wolfcam-ql/fonts.  Ex:  copy arial.ttf into wolfcam-ql/myfonts/  and then in your hud config:

    //      font "fonts/smallfont" 12
    //      smallFont "fonts/smallfont" 24
    //      bigFont "fonts/smallfont" 48

        font "myfonts/arial.ttf" 12
        smallFont "myfonts/arial.ttf" 24
        bigFont "myfonts/arial.ttf" 48

* cg_printTimeStamps  1: game clock time, 2: cgame time,  default is 0
* access to key bindings for demo playback demo keys no longer hard coded.  Ex: "bind SPACE freecam" in console or config to change the default.

  wolfcam_drawFollowing

  All of the above can be enabled/disabled with the cvar without the appended
  x/y

* cg_drawSpawns,  2 enables wall hack effect.  Drawn in red, with the
  preferred initial spawns in yellow/gold
* freecam   type /freecam in console, movement keys are hard coded:
  wasd  and mouse2 or space for moving up
  cg_freecam_noclip, cg_freecam_sensitivity, cg_freecam_speed
  also execs freecamon.cfg and freecamoff.cfg
* crosshair names for freecam and wolfcam

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* scoreboard shows clients that have connected since last scores update
* team models and colors

  wolfcam_teamModel ""              // disable
