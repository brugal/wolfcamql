  - Added cg_drawHitFriendTime to allow players to disable the orange hit triangle, or alter its blink duration. Defaults to 1500 (1.5 seconds).
  - Lowered the default value of cg_drawDeadFriendTime from 5000.0f to 3000.0f (5 seconds to 3 seconds).

* clientoverride randomEnemy.fx setting demo taker as team spec in ca demos
* clientoverride  connect script for players that connect
* clientoverride 'us' and clan arena changing cg.snap->ps.clientNum
* join team exec script for /clientoverride
* include randomEnemy.fx
* fx force also temp/heat
* drawspawns allow selected model and shader, currently
  teleportEffect  models/powerups/pop.md3
* video save location
* cg_vibrate cumulative ?
* fx force can be negative (attract particles)
* check s_maxSoundRepeatTime 0.000001 if that causes the echo
* check runfx player/gibbed with devmap -- no blood trail and not reacting to forces
* /devmap campgrounds them /demo gib03insta  got error "area >= cm.numAreas"
  use fxfile and addbots first
* q3mme fx compatability broken in last 2 releases:  emitterScriptEnd
   emitter 6 {
     sprite
     distance 50 {

  distance not called if it comes after

* q3mme fx compatability broken in last 2 releases:  adding entities as
  pointers lets script code change values after they have been added:

  weapon/rocket/impact {
    emitter 1 {
       Sprite
       // size will goto zero after 0.5 of the time
       size 300 * clip(2 - 2*lerp)
       Light

  size changes the size of the 'Sprite' as well as Light

* q3mme fx compatibility not enough with those two... have to make sprite, model, etc.. drawing directives and only the emitter is a particle entity with a script

* check if mac spams about q_strncpyz() overlap
* drawhitfriend change to 0 and 1500 while in freecam icon changes size
(paused)
* drawhitfriend preventing dead friend icon.. check ql precedence
* q3 single player intermission missing score see trodas1.dm_68

* drawSurfs use entityNum for sort value
* shader sort spam
* fx: interval sometimes called twice in the same frame?

wolfcamql 11.0test15 client (Feb 17 2016)

* --version command doesn't show anything in Windows (no console output) -- 2019-01-25 with --console-output "--version" is ignored

* R_GetCommandBuffer() command dropped
  with con_scale 0.00..1  --  CON_TEXTSIZE > MAX_RENDER_COMMANDS
* utf8 with con_win32 input
* mark hud only referenced cvars like cg_drawSpecMessages
* why the 'plus 1' for xSkip?  glyph.xSkip = (face->glyph->metrics.horiAdvance >> 6) + 1;
* CG_Text_Paint_Limit() missing 'style'
* CG_AddDamagePlum()  xadj (glyph->left)
* create name sprites missing glyph horiz offset
* "Usually, an error occurs with a fixed-size font format (like FNT or PCF) when trying to set the pixel size to a value that is not listed in the face->fixed_sizes array."
* font sheets for glyphs
* blood:  http://www.gimpusers.com/tutorials/blood-splatter-texture
* force extra workshop ids
* utf8 q3_ui
* check for MAX_QPATH that should be OS MAX_PATH
* run console and process event during loading screen
* mac vm shows flashing flag texture at the start of okremix*91  -- 2016-03-08 happens with ioq3 as well
* font cvar "" still forcing 24 point size  -- ok this is cg_qlFontScaling
* create name sprite point size check make name consistent with other cvar point size checks
* document ql font scaling and fonts set to ""
* fragtoken:  CG_Text_Width|Height() take into account x and y offset options*
* frag message call ui or fx code
* Q_stricmpn(s, s2, strlen(s2) - 1)  why -1 ???
* CG_Text_Pic_Paint, CG_Text_Pic_Paint_Width, etc.. limit needs utf8 support
* CG_Text_Paint_Width|Height doesn't increase 'count' for limit check like CG_Text_Paint() does
* duplicate code with Text*Paint() functions and Width() Height() .. same function with extended options
* CG_Text_Width|Height not treating count the same as Paint() for limit
* frag token %{font} specify default qlfont  -- 2016-03-11 allows for empty font name but still qlfont check uses pointer to fontInfo to check for old ql default font
* console history cursor up seems to have fixed line width
* cg_obituaryTokens "%{scale 2.0}%{font q3big}%k %{iconscale 2.5}%i %{scale 0.7}%{font qlfont}%v"   z_malloc error  -- 2016-03-13 this comes from the random point size being sent with the call to registerfont()  (ex: pointsize 552499848)  -- validate sscanf return value in createfragstring()

 Yakumo [has Quake Live] 2 hours ago
 just /condump namelist.txt some time you see someone with black in the name, then you can open namelist.txt and see how it's done.
 ^^0 will give black, but the leading ^ will still show, I never checked into how people tricked it into working as I wasn't after the colour.  -- 2016-05-08 still works the same as ql

* team info protocol 91 -- is command needed or just use info from entityState?
* option to get player sounds from head instead of torso/legs model?
* check cg_forceModel and new headmodel support
* move more EM_* into cg_t
* Wolfcam_LoadEnemyModel() and Wolfcam_LoadTeamModel() should be the same
* team skins should just be stored in clientInfo_t no need for things like cg.teamModel[Red|Blue]
* option to load all known workshops, for testing maps
* cg_drawSelf and health changes and hit marker, maybe different shape for demo taker icons
* option for info screen font
* for clan arena /follow victim|killer if it returns to teammate just return to pov as main preference or check pvs
* cg_thirdperson and team settings doesn't work
* /follow *  and cg_thirdPerson 1 doesn't show player
* /freecam stops /follow * from working, goes back to demo pov but /follow still says it's following someone else
* team equivalent to EM_Loaded?
* /follow and cg_disallowEnemyModelForTeammates still uses enemy model for 1st person pov?
* clean up CG_CheckForModelChange()
* ql world death shader icons/icon_frag no alpha blend ? -- 2016-05-28 apparently not
* /model "doom/-headcolor"

  Com_sprintf: output length 64 too short, require 65 bytes.

* check alt skins with clientoverride
* demo smoothing /follow

* save Info_ValueForKey values in cg_newdraw.c (ex:  CS_SERVERINFO "teamsize")
* option to sort feeder for scoreboard based on alive status
* /follow [victim|killer] [clientNum]
* setup menu changing values in console doesn't update displayed values (ex:  cg_drawCrosshair)

* timescale 1.5 when recording makes it slower when watching video?  https://steamcommunity.com/app/282440/discussions/0/451848855024054074/?ctp=3  -- 2016-07-28 couldn't reproduce
* ^  flag icon more visible?
* overflow player name in end game stats : engame-stats-player-name-overflow.dm_91
* zoom 2 pov  stuck  zoom-stuck-2-57.dm_91  -- 2016-07-31  seems to be a fov script, can't fix
* confusion between cgs.protocol and cgs.realProtocol
* /at now+3sec  (offset for 'now' and also option to run only once)
* option for /wait with exact time instead of frame time
* q3mme command time based demo smoothing
* q3mme video pipe -- https://github.com/brugal/wolfcamql/issues/27
* /follow duel player maybe play hitsounds if damage plum present
* vm cgame create failed:  not enough storage to process this command
* doc for cg_roundScoreBoard

* info screen should show map substitutions and force map setting
* cpma ctfs always says 'defend the flag'
* cpma ctfs ctfs1.dm_68 wcstats not showing kills/deaths
* cpma ft frozen player shows harvester icons, thawing teammate shows as frag with watch your fire message, round starts

* dedicated win32 loadlibrary error always "unknown"
* /follow victim, switch to freecam [ENTER] and player is not visible
* draw keypress:  walk (LEGS_WALK)
* WCG_ for following
* accuracy against player
* why is it not enough to set scissor to size of viewport (RB_SetGL2D()) for post processing?
* should only disable blanking/screensaver during demo playback or playing and set back to normal for menu
