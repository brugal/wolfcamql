* how are angles treated before going to ent
* select cam points and /transition viewpoints  will change all selected to have viewpoints and move evenly from the first to the last
* add, edit, basiccly anything stops camera playing -- also need to stop camera playing  CG_TimeChange()

  - Added cg_drawHitFriendTime to allow players to disable the orange hit triangle, or alter its blink duration. Defaults to 1500 (1.5 seconds).
  - Lowered the default value of cg_drawDeadFriendTime from 5000.0f to 3000.0f (5 seconds to 3 seconds).

* clientoverride randomEnemy.fx setting demo taker as team spec in ca demos
* check ioquake3 RE_RegisterSkin()

* join team exec script for /clientoverride

* q3mme fx compatability broken in last 2 releases:  emitterScriptEnd
   emitter 6 {
     sprite
     distance 50 {

  distance not called if it comes after

* q3mme fx compatability broken in last 2 releases:  adding entities as
  pointers lets script code change values after they have been added:

  weapon/rocket/impact {
    emitter 1 {
       Sprite
       // size will goto zero after 0.5 of the time
       size 300 * clip(2 - 2*lerp)
       Light

  size changes the size of the 'Sprite' as well as Light

* q3mme fx compatibility not enough with those two... have to make sprite, model, etc.. drawing directives and only the emitter is a particle entity with a script

* check if mac spams about q_strncpyz() overlap
* drawhitfriend change to 0 and 1500 while in freecam icon changes size
(paused)
* drawhitfriend preventing dead friend icon.. check ql precedence
* q3 single player demo treated as race type (see screenshots/shot0061.jpg)
* q3 single player intermission missing score see trodas1.dm_68
* crash:
