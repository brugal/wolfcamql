2394 Changes from Ensiform:
- In G_AddBot, try to allocate clientNum before doing anything else.
- In G_AddBot, don't set SVF_BOT and inuse. It's done in ClientConnect, plus inuse causes ClientDisconnect to be run for no reason.
- In G_AddBot, only set skill in bot useinfo once.
- Avoid using cl->ps.clientNum to check if cl is a bot.
