     Patch from Tremulous / description from Zack Middleton: (#5041)

     Clear game logfile handle after closing file. (patch from tremulous)

     Game does not clear logFile handle when closing file. Might be an issue if
     G_LogPrintf is called after this.

2037
     Patch and description by ensiform (#5043):

     This patch moves cg_particles.c out of cg_marks.c to the actual file that was already there but not used.  By default WOLF_PARTICLES definition is commented out if someone wants to use the old cg_particles.c changes.  cg_particles.c has been added to the makefile and msvc projects.

2106
    Change DLL search path order for external libraries that are linked at runtime, like libcurl or libopenal to:
       * system library paths
       * executable path

2109 Bug 5134 - q3_ui incorrectly tells user to refresh servers while auto-refreshing, patch by Zack Middleton

2110 Some more removal of unused code in addition to r2104, by Zack Middleton

2111
    Fix pak order when reconnecting to a server.
    When /connect to the same server is issued while already connected, an initial call to CL_Disconnect will remove all pak file references
    and reset the pak order.
    Reordering only occurs through FS_Restart, which in turn is called when checksum feed changes. Because we reconnect to the same server,
    checksum feed never changes and pak file order is not restored to server order again. With certain pak file constellations between client/server,
    this may result in an inability to load files from paks which are not correctly detected as referenced paks.

2112
    Modular rendering system. Patch by use.less01
    This might break MSVC builds. I'll take care of it later

2113 Add forgotten file for last rev

2322 Fix resetting single player level selection in q3_ui when there is no training level, such as in demoq3.

2323 skip (not needed):  Play correct team sounds when in spectator mode and following a player.

2324 Don't include client.h in sdl_glimp.c as it is part of the external renderer lib.

2325 Check last listener number instead of clc.clientNum in S_AL_HearingThroughEntity so sound work correctly when spectate following a client. (Related to bug 5741.)

2326 When in third person, don't play player's sounds as full volume in Base sound system. OpenAL already does this. (Related to bug 5741.)

2327

    From /dev/humancontroller:
    really fix the confusion with game entity and refentity numbers

    for any natural number M, the following is logical as a whole:
    - the array size for refentities is M;
    - the refentity number limit is M-1, ie., each refentity number is in [0..M-1];
    - the special number for the world is M.

    before r1429, the code was roughly the following:

    // constants related to the game, should not be used by the renderer

    // renderer stuff
    refEntity_t refEntities[MAX_ENTITIES];
    int numRefEntities = 0;

    void addRefEntity(refEntity_t re)
    {
	if (numRefEntities >= ENTITYNUM_WORLD)
		return; // full
	refEntities[numRefEntities++] = re;
    }

    void render(int num)
    {
	if (num == ENTITYNUM_WORLD)
		renderWorld();
	else
		renderRefEntity(refEntities[num]);
    }

    so before r1429,
    - the array size for refentities was 1023;
    - the refentity number limit was 1021, ie., each refentity number was in [0..1021]; and
    - the special number for the world entity was 1022.
    this was a small waste of memory, as the last array element wasn't used.

    r1429 changed
	if (numRefEntities >= ENTITYNUM_WORLD)
    to
	if (numRefEntities >= MAX_ENTITIES).

    this creates the following configuration:
    - the array size for refentities is 1023;
    - the refentity number limit is 1022, ie., each refentity number is in [0..1022]; and
    - the special number for the world entity is 1022.

    r1429 just makes things worse: it allows 1 more refentity to be added, but that entity doesn't get drawn anyway, as its number will be equal to the special number for the world. this is a small waste of not only memory, but also processing time.

    perhaps in XreaL,

    ENTITYNUM_WORLD is a game entity constant, and has nothing to do with refentities. a new REFENTITYNUM_WORLD constant should be added to denote the special number for the world, and that constant should be used in the renderer code in place of ENTITYNUM_WORLD. so define such a constant, and let it be equal to MAX_ENTITIES, which is 1023.


2328
    From /dev/humancontroller:
    to further reduce confusion, rename constants like MAX_ENTITIES to MAX_REFENTITIES

2329 Added Rend2, an alternate renderer. (Bug #4358)
2330 Fix restoring fs_game when default.cfg is missing.
2331 Added myself to the list of maintainers.
2332 Fix gcc warnings in Rend2.
2333 Remove gfxmeminfo command when shuting down Rend2.
2334 Add smiletheory to credits in q3_ui.

2335 Split Rend2's printing OpenGL extensions string (> 1024 characters) into separate function and merged into opengl1 renderer. (Fixes bug #5559.)

2336 Merge changes to GL_Cull from Rend2 into opengl1 renderer, behavior is the same.

2337 Remove speed claim until Rend2 beats opengl1 under typical circumstances.

2338 Fix FBO_*() usage when framebuffers are unavailable or undesired.

2339 Remove ARRAY_SIZE, and use ARRAY_LEN instead.

2340 no (removed in later patch:  51df89ab132b8e05d9854df507c73e54fbd2884b)
    From /dev/humancontroller:
    fix the SMP functionality not being utilized (as of the import of Rend2)

2341
    From /dev/humancontroller:
    when hard-linking renderers, put the old renderer (not the new one) into the "ioquake3" executable, and use a distinguished "ioquake3_rend2" executable for the new renderer
    (Fixes bug #5789.)

2342 Remove initializing "sv_mapname" cvar in game. It's set to "" and never used.

2343
    Fix some non-ASCII characters.
    Patch originally by /dev/humancontroller, modified by me.

2344 Show reason non-default renderer failed to load.
2345 Clean up getting pshadowMap in Rend2's R_DecomposeSort().

2346 Fix restoring old fs_game upon leaving a server. Patch by Ensiform.

2347 Don't draw cursor during Team Arena's loading screen.

2348 Ensure the correct FBO is bound when drawing. (Fixes bug #5791.)

2349 Change more operator commands to require sv_running to be usable. Patch by Ensiform.

2350 When calling qglDrawRangeElementsEXT(), use proper start and end parameters.

2351 Fix bugs where some surfaces weren't merged and others were counted as merged in R_MergeLeafSurfaces().

2352 Various shader fixes and optimizations.

2353 Fix some "> MAX_*" to be ">= MAX_*".

2354 Change error message in CL_ConfigstringModified to specify out of range index like in server.

2355 Fix follow command to find clients whose name begins with a number.

2356
    - Fix up "gc" command, make it more like "tell". Based on patch by Ensiform.
    - Add usage messages for gc, tell, vtell, and votell commands.
    - Check player names in gc, tell, vtell, and votell commands.

2357 Remove anti tamper leftover code 'CL_ChangeReliableCommand'. From Ensiform.

2358 #5799 - Change messagemode text box to display colors like in console input box.

2359 Improve "play" command, based on a patch from Ensiform.
2360 Remove unneeded name buffer in S_Play_f.

2361
    - Check for invalid filename in OpenAL's RegisterSound function.
    - Changed Base sound system to warn not error when sound filename is empty or too long.

2362 Remove references to non-existent functions CM_MarkFragments and CM_LerpTag.

2363 Make software overbright optional (cvar r_softOverbright) and reduce the number of FBOs and FBO blits when able.

2364
    Changes suggested by DevHC:
    - Remove "!target" checks from tell, vtell, and gc commands. Target was just set, cannot be NULL.
    - Validate "order" in gc command before "player id."

2365 Update standalone code in Catch the Chicken NSIS installer.
2366 Remove unused function CL_DisconnectPacket. Pointed out by Ensiform.
2367 Fix function prototype for Info_RemoveKey_Big. Pointed out by Ensiform.

2368 In q3_ui if uis.demoversion is set, hide "Team Arena" and "Mods" in main menu. (They aren't shown in id's q3a demo and use to be drawn under demo message).

2369 Add length check here as well, thanks Ensiform
2370 #5808 - Include and use .glsl in source (rend2)
2371 Oops, fix line endings in new files in previous commit

2372 #5812 - Use refdef's coordinates when drawing to screen shadow fbo, and separate depth texture and screen texture coordinates in glsl shaders.

2373 From /dev/humancontroller: Typo.

2374
    - Include Rend2 renderer in MacOSX bundle.
    - Include OpenGL1 and Rend2 renderers in MacOSX UB

2375 Include Rend2 renderer in NSIS installer.
2376 Include OpenGL1 and Rend2 renderers in Loki Setup Installer.

2377 Have NSIS uninstaller delete rend2.

2378 Split light sample into direct and ambient parts when using deluxemaps or per-vertex light vectors.  Fixes #5813.

2379 Fix writting voip data in demos (broke in r2102).

2380 Fix server ignoring client move commands if voip data is included.

2381
    - Allow changing cl_voip without restarting.
    - Fix assert failing in CL_ParseVoip() while flipping cl_voip off and on.

2382 Only declare var_SampleToView in lightall shader when it is actually used.

2383 Fix a couple files not ending with a newline.


2384 Fix clients being able to reset their player state and respawn using donedl.

2385
    Fix passing arg9 (qvm only), arg10, and arg11 to vmMain for native libs and non-i386 compiled or interpated qvms. (Currently they aren't use in vmMain in game, cgame, or ui.)
    Fix passing args[11] to args[15] from vm to engine on ppc64 and sparc64. Some of the args are used by game bot prediction syscalls. May have been causing bugs. Note: This was fixed for x86_64 in r2163.

2386 Fix reconnect command to work after leaving server. (#5794)

2387 Fix dedicated server crashing when using MSG_ReadDelta*, though it only happens if someone modifies the engine. (#5449)

2388 Makefile fixes for OpenBSD by Jonathan Gray. (#5728)

2389
    Save all arguments from connect for reconnect command.
    Remove unnecessary localhost check from reconnect command.

2390  Support r_srgb even without hardware support.  Also tweak default autoexposure/tonemap settings to look good on both r_srgb 0 and 1.

2391  Missed a file in the previous commit.
2392  Changed the MacOS-X build system to make UB's containing i386 and x86_64 arches and made make-macosx.sh not build UB's but only standard binaries

2393
    - Fix spectator client being switched from follow to free after map_restart if following a client with a higher client number.
    - Fix client unlinking issue caused by ent->s.number being set to followed client's ps->clientNum after map_restart. Reported by Ensiform.

2394
    Changes from Ensiform:
    - In G_AddBot, try to allocate clientNum before doing anything else.
    - In G_AddBot, don't set SVF_BOT and inuse. It's done in ClientConnect, plus inuse causes ClientDisconnect to be run for no reason.
    - In G_AddBot, only set skill in bot useinfo once.
    - Avoid using cl->ps.clientNum to check if cl is a bot.

2395 Fix bot skill format so it doesn't always have a space at the beginning of it.

2396 More fixes to the macosx buildsystem.  This removes the SDL Framework and makes use of a SDL library that is position independant.  This also brings back PPC builds into the UB and also as a standa alone build choice.

2397 mv .svnignore .gitignore

2398 Have make-macosx.sh require the user to specify which architecture she/he wants to build for and suggest building UB's if the user is unaware of what architectures are

2399 Lets list all the valid options.

    [The lcc source] overrides the libc memmove() with its own implementation,
    but that implementation fails to follow the specification. In particular,
    it returns NULL rather than memmove()'s first parameter.

    GCC now optimizes based on this aspect of the specification, so things go
    wrong at runtime.

    Add USE_INTERNAL_LIBS, a default for USE_INTERNAL_*

    Linux distributions that want to link dependencies externally will
    generally want to link (almost) every dependency externally; similarly,
    minimal-dependency builds that want to use the embedded copies of
    dependencies will generally want to do so for (almost) every dependency.
    Make it easier to choose one of those by setting USE_INTERNAL_LIBS=0
    or USE_INTERNAL_LIBS=1, respectively.

    The default can still be overridden per-dependency; for instance,
    "make USE_INTERNAL_LIBS=0 USE_INTERNAL_OPUS=1" will use the system
    version of everything except Opus.

2013-05-19-01
    Centralize checks for Freetype, with a user override

    This lets us find a library in a non-standard library directory
    (via -L in the pkg-config metadata), and allows overrides similar to
    the Autoconf convention, e.g.

        make FREETYPE_CFLAGS=-I/opt/freetype/include \
            FREETYPE_LIBS="-L/opt/freetype/lib -lfreetype"

    If pkg-config didn't work, assume that Freetype is in the default
    location.

2013-05-19-02
    Allow libcurl to be in a non-standard location on all platforms

    We didn't add CURL_CFLAGS to CLIENT_CFLAGS on all platforms, and didn't
    use CURL_LIBS at all, so if "pkg-config --libs" returned "-L... -lcurl"
    or even "/.../libcurl.a", it wouldn't work.

2013-05-19-03
    Allow OpenAL to be in a non-standard location on all platforms

    Similar to libcurl, we didn't use OPENAL_LIBS and assumed it was
    always "-lopenal".

2013-05-19-04
    Allow system libjpeg to be in a non-standard location

    It doesn't have pkg-config metadata (at least on Debian), so if the
    user doesn't override it, assume normal system paths.

2013-05-19-05 Find system zlib via user override, pkg-config or in standard locations

2013-05-19-06
    Look for system Vorbis, Opus and Ogg via pkg-config

    As usual, the order of precedence is: user override, pkg-config,
    or assume they're in standard locations.

    In particular, Opus isn't in the default search path on Debian.

2013-05-19-07 Find Speex via user override, pkg-config or default search path

    In 1FCTF, only neutral flag, BFG, and BFG ammo were predicted for pickup. WP_BFG is equal to PW_NEUTRALFLAG.

    Example of issue: if mouse1 is bound to +attack when clicking Resume Game, player will shoot until releasing the mouse button.
    Mouse button should have to be released and pressed again before player will shoot.

    Fix SDL2 losing event subsystem

    Quiting SDL Video or Joystick subsystem implies quiting the Event subsystem
in SDL2.
    SDL keeps track of number of init and shutdown calls for each subsystem.
    Shuting down video or joystick more or equal to number of times they're inited will lead to event shutdown.

    Toggling in and out of fullscreen or running in_restart twice causes SDL event subsystem to shutdown, making input not work.

    If the console is closed, IN_GobbleMotionEvents gets stuck in a loop. SDL_PeepEvents returns -1 when there is an error, but we assume non-0 means read more events.

    IN_ShutdownJoystick needs to check if joystick subsystem was inited before quitting it, otherwise we may cause SDL event subsystem to shutdown.

    Don't wash out HDR vertex lite surfaces in OpenGL2

    Vertex lite surfaces being brighter than light maps looks bad,
    they're meant to look the same. Especially in ET, which mixes
    them fequently. It's noticeable in Q3 too though.

    BSP lightmaps (i.e. not external HDR lightmaps) use
    R_ColorShiftLightingBytes, now *Floats (used by vertex colors)
    has the same behavior.

    This may be a problem for HDR lightmaps, as the RGB will always be
    scaled to 0.0 to 1.0 range.

    I had enabled this for non-HDR before, but now HDR needs it too.

    When R_GetEntityToken returns qfalse it resets pointer for parsing, by
    R_ParseSpawnVars not returning qfalse it could cause an infinite loop.

    Also add newlines to printfs.

    Fix R_GetEntityToken ending prematurely

    If spawn var key or value is "" it caused R_GetEntityToken (available to
    cgame, used by opengl2) to stop parsing, whereas game VM would continue.

    Changed it to match parsing used for game VM
    (see G_GET_ENTITY_TOKEN in code/server/sv_game.c).

    The map poq3dm5 has a "wait" key with value "".

    DMA 44100Hz needs more memory for sound buffers

    It doubles the size of the data compared to the default (22050),
    so increase the buffer automatically. Likewise, decreasing speed
    doesn't need as much (though that doesn't really matter).

    Fix FS_FOpenFileReadDir non-zero file handle when file not found in pk3

    If a pk3 search path is passed to FS_FOpenFileReadDir, a non-zero
    file handle is returned if file is not found. This causes incorrect
    behavior in FS_ReadFileDir (when a pk3 search path is passed in)
    which only checks file handle, not length, for seeing if file exists.

    I don't know of any issues in ioq3 caused by this.

    Fix cg.skulltrails out of bounds access in Team Arena Harvester mode

    In Team Arena's Harvester mode, players corrupt your memory from beyond
    the grave. Gib the players to stop the corruption!

    CG_PlayerTokens is called for player entities, including corpses.
    The entity number is used for the index in cg.skulltrails which only has
    MAX_CLIENTS elements. This results in incorrect memory being overwritten
    for corpse entities (as the entity number is >= MAX_CLIENTS).

    So limit skull trails to valid entities (entity number < MAX_CLIENTS).

    OpenGL2 don't try to dlight surfaces that had all dlights culled

    In the renderers, dlightbits are never cleared from world surfaces.
    The dlight image does not repeat, so if it draws on extra surfaces it's
    not visible.

    However if using a repeating image (tr.defaultImage instead of tr.dlightImage);

      * In OpenGL1 image is only drawn on surfaces close to dlight origin.
      * In OpenGL2 image is draw on surfaces clearly outside the dlight radius, including past non-dlighted surfaces.

    It seems there was a similar issue with pshadowBits. So update surface
    dlightBits even if 0, like already done for pshadowBits. This causes
    only surfaces close to origin to be affected. (Though it is a little
    farther than in OpenGL1.)

    I have no idea why this isn't a problem in OpenGL1.

    rendered, but it's glyph information was not stored in fontInfo_t and
    not saved into .dat file (including the ones in Team Arena).

    Attempting to load it from existing .dat font files is fine because
    shader name is "" and gets 0 handle. The handle was already 0 anyway.

    Fix negative glyph index in Team Arena text functions

    Team Arena's text functions cast signed char values to int and use as an array index.
    This works fine for values 0 to 127, but not for -128 to -1 which are a negative array index.
    Instead use "character & 255" like client and original Q3 ui/cgame string drawing code.

    Fix cg.intermissionStarted only being enabled at first intermission

    Game sets CS_INTERMISSION to 1 at intermission, but does not clear it at
    map_restart so it's only sent the first time. CG_MapRestart manually clears
    cg.intermissionStarted (which is set to value of CS_INTERMISSION when it's
    modified). So subsequent intermissions do not have cg.intermissionStarted
    enabled.

    Now CS_INTERMISSION is cleared and sent each time intermission is started
    and cg.intermissionStarted is enabled each time.

    This makes subsequent intermissions not play sounds in CG_CheckLocalSounds
    during the 1 second between intermission starting and switching to scoreboard
    (PM_INTERMISSION) and makes Team Arena voice chats not play.

    When the engine is compiled with Clang it appears that the return value
    is being written to the WRONG address, either due to the vm_ variables being
    changed (unexpectedly) elsewhere, or as a result of bad assembly assumptions;
    having a stack variable pointing to where to write the return value seems
    to do the trick.

    This fixes the case where, for a trap_Register()-like call, weird numbers
    are being returned when, during the process, an error message is printed
    (which in Tremulous results in a QVM call and (nested) system call).

2015-07-14-01
    Makefile: confine $(LIB) to the one platform that needs it, namely irix64

    It isn't mentioned anywhere else, and deleting it from the Linux code
    path means we don't need to maintain an exhaustive list of 64-bit
    architectures.

2015-07-14-02
    build: canonicalize all ARM variants to "arm", matching q_platform.h

    The ARCH in the Makefile must match the ARCH_STRING in q_platform.h;
    otherwise, ioquake3 will install (for instance) uiARCH.so but look for
    uiARCH_STRING.so, which isn't going to go well (particularly for
    the modular renderer).

    Like i386, but unlike most (all?) other Linux platforms, uname -m on
    32-bit ARM machines can have various results starting with "arm",
    depending on the specific CPU version (e.g. Raspberry Pi is armv6l,
    RPi2 is armv7l). Again similar to the x86 family,
    it's appropriate for them to share an architecture suffix;
    q_platform.h has traditionally used "arm" so let's use that.

    64-bit ARM makes a clean break from this, much like 64-bit x86 does:
    uname -m produces a string not starting with arm (specifically
    "aarch64"), and gcc predefines __aarch64__ instead of __arm__.
    As a result, it is unaffected by this change.

2015-07-14-03
    build: define ARCH_STRING in Makefile on Linux and other GNU platforms

    GNU platforms (Linux, kFreeBSD, Hurd) have endian.h to determine
    endianness, so all architectures except x86_64 are in fact treated
    identically, except that their ARCH_STRING is different.
    The ARCH_STRING must always be identical to the ARCH from the Makefile,
    otherwise the engine will not find its cgame, game and ui plugins
    under their expected names and startup will fail. If we pass it in
    from the Makefile, then an identical value is guaranteed, and we can
    get rid of an increasingly long list of defined(__some_cpu__) tests.

    The one remaining quirk is that we test __x86_64__ to determine
    whether to define idx64; I've kept that, but separated it from
    the ARCH_STRING.

    On non-Linux platforms we only support a few architectures anyway,
    so keeping the list up to date is less of a burden; *BSD porters
    could probably use the same technique to get support for lots of
    architectures with little effort, but I have not done that here,
    because I cannot test it.

    Windows must continue to support preprocessor-based architecture tests
    in any case, so that the MSVC solutions (which do not use the Makefile)
    can continue to work. However, Windows only runs on a few CPU families,
    so this shouldn't be a significant burden in practice.

    When cross-compiling, the tools are compiled for the build architecture
    (COMPILE_PLATFORM, COMPILE_ARCH) rather than the host architecture
    (PLATFORM, ARCH), so define ARCH_STRING to COMPILE_ARCH on a GNU
    COMPILE_PLATFORM.

    Use Opus for VoIP

    Server/client VoIP protocol is handled by adding new cvars
    cl_voipProtocol and sv_voipProtocol, sv_voip and cl_voip
    are used to auto set/clear them. All users need to touch
    are cl/sv_voip as 0 or 1 just like before.

    Old Speex VoIP packets in demos are skipped.
    New VoIP packets are skipped in demos if sv_voipProtocol
    doesn't match cl_voipProtocol.

    Notable difference between usage of speex and opus codecs,
    when using Speex client would be sent 80ms at a time.
    Using Opus, 60ms is sent at a time. This was changed because
    the Opus codec supports encoding up to 60ms at a time.
    (Simpler to send only one codec frame in a packet.)

    Explicitly set cull type for skybox to front, instead of using whatever
    cull type the previous shader used (which could result in the skybox
    not being visible due to only drawing back faces). The sky cloud stages
    set the cull type so they are not affected by previous cull type.

    Improve keyboard/joystick input in Team Arena UI

    Make Yes/No, Multi, Slider, and Bind items allow enter key to change
    value without mouse over item. Add support for left and right arrow keys
    and joystick button 1-4 to Yes/No, Multi, and Slider and many item
    specific 'ownerdraw' key handlers.

    Listbox still requires mouse hover and Team Arena main menu requires
    mouse hover to get anywhere...

    Enabling K_JOY1-4 to select in default key handler also caused additional
    mouse button (K_AUX1-16) to select, which is done in q3_ui as well. Both
    handle K_AUX equally badly (not treated as a mouse button and not handled
    by item specific key handlers), so it's probably fine.

    Prevent CL_RunCinematic from reading cinTable[-1]

    At the end of CL_RunCinematic, RoQShutdown sets currentHandle to -1.
    This causes the return at the end to be return cinTable[-1].status.
    Use return FMV_EOF when RoQShutdown is called.

    I think FMV_EOF should be returned instead of FMV_IDLE which is set in
    RoQShutdown because RoQShutdown is clearing out state so it can be reused
    for a new cinematic.

    The return value isn't actually read by the ioq3 client, renderers,
    cgame, or ui.

    Fix bot team order to kill last player it killed

    Bot's lastkilledplayer was set to -1 after carrying out an ordered kill.
    Later in BotChat_Random() the PlayerName function was passed -1 which
    caused a "Error: PlayerName: playernum out of range" message.

    I think the reason it was set to negative one is so that if the bot is
    ordered to kill the player again, the bot will not say it's done and
    drop the goal. Though, if the bot killed the player based on it's own
    decision, it will just say it's done and drop the goal (bug?).

    Let's check the time of the last kill to see if it happened since the
    team order was received instead of setting lastkilledplayer to -1
    after completing the team ordered kill. This fixes bot dropping goal
    if target player was the last player they killed and the PlayerName
    out of range error.

2016-06-15-01
    Make using Yacc optional, disabled by default

    A built-in GNU Make rule causes code/tools/lcc/lburg/gram.y to replace
    gram.c if gram.y has a newer modified time. This causes git diff to
    pick up changes to gram.c, which seems to have been manually modified
    to fix warnings and may vary by Yacc used to create it. It also
    requires installing a program to generate a file that already exists
    in a usable state in the code repository.

    So replace the built-in rule so it is only used if USE_YACC is 1
    (defaults to 0). The Yacc executable name can be overriden using
    `make YACC=yacc` like before.

    I preferred to touch gram.c instead of installing Yacc because of the
    problems it causes. It doesn't really seem like a good idea to recommend
    others do that instead of disabling Yacc the Makefile though.

    Pick up date from SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, for reproducible builds

    The goal of reproducible builds is that a rebuild of the same source
    code with the same compiler, libraries, etc. should result in the same
    binaries. SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH provides a standard way for build systems

    snd_wavelet: avoid undefined pointer below array bounds

    Given an array b[] of length n, pointers to &b[0]..&b[n] are defined
    (where only &b[0]..&b[n-1] can be validly dereferenced). &b[-1], or
    equivalently b-1, is not something we can use in valid Standard C.

    gcc 6 diagnoses this as:

    code/client/snd_wavelet.c:33:9: warning: array subscript is below array bounds [-Warray-bounds]

    and might take this undefined behaviour as permission to emit
    "more efficient" object code that is not what the author expected,
    for example nothing at all. Use a macro to fake a 1-based array instead.

    UI_BuildFindPlayerList: avoid array underflow

    This function is used in the Team Arena menus

    I don't think it's actually possible to reach this line with
    foundPlayerServerNames < 1, because by the time we get here we have
    set it to 1 + the actual number of servers; but if we did, it would
    clearly underflow into foundPlayerServerNames[-1], which would be
    undefined behaviour. gcc 6 diagnoses this with a warning:

    code/ui/ui_main.c: In function ‘UI_BuildFindPlayerList’:
    code/ui/ui_main.c:4138:16: warning: array subscript is below array bounds [-Warray-bounds]

    Also correct the sizeof() invocation to make it more obviously
    correct (in fact the buffers for names and addresses happen to both
    be of size MAX_ADDRESSLENGTH, so it was fine, but it's good to be
    obvious).

2016-09-25-03
    UI_BuildFindPlayerList: make a sizeof() more obviously correct

    As with the other branch of the if/else, each element of
    foundPlayerServerNames is in fact the same size as each element of
    foundPlayerServerAddresses, so it was fine; but it's better to make
    it obvious that we are using the right array sizes.

    Offer post-crash safe settings on a per-mod basis

    Offer to restore settings when loading a mod that crashed, not the first
    mod that gets loaded after a crash. Before the first mod loaded (usually
    baseq3) would get the option even if missionpack or some other mod crashed.

    - Make pid files separate for each fs_game.
    - Remove/write pid every time switching fs_game.
    - Create path before writing pid file otherwise it fails on first run.
    - Show mod description.txt or fs_game instead of engine name in abnormal
      exit message.
    - Check com_fullyInitialized in Com_Error before removing PID,
      otherwise "ioquake3 --version" segfaults when accessing fs_gamevar->string
      (plus not fully initialized isn't really a normal shutdown).

    I don't know of a way to trigger ERR_DROP, in FS_Restart for instance,
    without engine changes however.

    Avoid 'register' declarations

    gcc 6 with -Wall -Wextra warns:

    code/botlib/l_precomp.c: In function ‘PC_NameHash’:
    code/botlib/l_precomp.c:551:2: warning: ‘register’ is not at beginning of declaration [-Wold-style-declaration]
      int register hash, i;
      ^~~

    Modern compilers either ignore the register storage class when
    generating code, or generate better code without it, so just remove
    most of them.

    The remaining uses are in third-party bundled libraries (libjpeg, zlib),
    and in a PowerPC-specific inline function consisting of inline
    assembler (because I'm not 100% confident that it doesn't have
    some practical use there).

    +set didn't allow value to be multiple tokens which due to Unix shell
    unintuitively removing quotes causes the variable to only be set to
    the first token. This could be worked around by escaping quotes

    but it doesn't match behavior of other start up commands (which now

    Don't start a vote after vote passed for map change

    Processing a callvote command after a vote passed to change maps but
    has not been executed yet will result in 1) map change immediately
    happening 2) after new map loads players have vote HUD messages but
    Game VM doesn't have a vote in progress. The phantom vote status will
    only be removed if players start a new vote or run vid_restart.

    The underlying issue is that a second callvote sets vote config
    strings but a map change is executed before they are sent to clients.
    Resulting in clients getting "cs" reliable commands with the config
    string changes _after_ the map change. Out of sync config strings.

    Even if the underlying issue was fixed, the second vote would be lost.
    So it's best to not force a map change to happen immediately anyway.

    Automatically get initial Internet servers in Team Arena UI

    Having to manually request the list, with two buttons (get new
    list, refresh list) is somewhat confusing. Also since it looks
    like there are no servers, users might not try to figure out
    how to get the server list.

    The first time viewing a master server list in Team Arena UI,
    automatically request a new server list. After that the cache
    will be available with a timestamp of the last refresh time.
    I think this will make it easier to understand how the menu
    works.

    This may cause unneeded updating of the server cache because the
    last refresh timestamp is per-fs_game but the server cache is
    shared by all games. This will only occur once for each game
    though so it's not a big concern.

    Make Team Arena server list sub-sort clients by max clients

    The player column in Team Arena UI lists clients and max clients

    max clients is ignored which results in player column being
    disorganized.

    When servers have the same number of clients, sort based on max
    clients. Otherwise client sort is sub-sorted based on order of
    getinfo responses (ping).

    The console message "1 servers listed in browser with 2 players."

    completed state or have timed out get reset. This means it starts
    with MAX_SERVERSTATUSREQUESTS (16) blank host names. So just ignore

    Initial add of rsa_tools.

    This is just a simple RSA public key digital signature thing built on
    libtomcrypt. The gist:

    Some admin will generate a public/private key with rsa_make_keys, keeping the
    private key secret. Using the private key and rsa_sign, the admin will sign
    the autoupdater manifests, generating manifest.txt.sig.

    The public key ships with the game (adding 270 bytes to the download), the
    .sig is downloaded with the manifest by the autoupdater (256 bytes extra
    download), then the autoupdater checks the manifest against the signature
    with the public key. if the signature isn't valid (the manifest was tampered
    with or corrupt), the autoupdater refuses to continue.

    If the manifest is to be trusted, it lists sha256 checksums for every file to
    download, so there's no need to sign every file; if they can't tamper with the
    manifest, they can't tamper with any other file to be updated since the file's
    listed sha256 won't match.

    If the private key is compromised, we generate new keys and ship new
    installers, so new installations will be able to update but existing ones
    will need to do a new install to keep getting updates. Don't let the private
    key get compromised. The private key doesn't go on a public server. Maybe it
    doesn't even live on the admin's laptop hard drive.

    If the download server is compromised and serving malware, the autoupdater
    will reject it outright if they haven't compromised the private key, generated
    a new manifest, and signed it with the private key.

    libtomcrypt is sort of a big pile of source code, so instead of putting it
    in revision control, we have a script to download it. Most things don't need
    it. It lives on GitHub, so we _could_ do a git submodule, but most people
    don't need it, so why waste their disk and bandwidth? That said, when compiled
    you end up with a few hundred kilobytes of binary code to verify a signature
    and no external dependencies, so it seems like a win.

    Fix g_teamAutoJoin and g_teamForceBalance

    There are various issues caused by not knowing the initial team for
    the local client and bots when they connect. This is can be reproduced
    by starting a team game from the main menu.

    When g_teamAutoJoin is enabled, bots and local client join a random
    team at connect and then execute their team command a few frames
    later. This may result in the player being killed if they specify a
    different team. In Team Arena's Harvester mode this causes harvester
    skulls to be spawned at the beginning of the game.

    When g_teamForceBalance is enabled, the local client and bots may not
    be able to join their desired team. This may result in them being
    spectators. If g_teamAutoJoin is also enabled they may be left on
    the opposite (red/blue) team they were meant to join.

    There is a hack for including bot's team in their player info string
    (used by cgame for which team skin to use) before the bot joins
    their desired team. Bots aren't guaranteed to join their desired team
    (as may happen when both g_teamAutoJoin and g_teamForceBalance are
    enabled) so clients may see them as being on the wrong team!

    ----

    Add teampref userinfo option for team preference. If teampref is set
    it will be used for attempting to join the team immediately at connect.

    Bots now join team at connect using teampref userinfo. So remove
    the hack for setting bot's team in player info string before the bot
    joins the team.

    To avoid the client sending teampref userinfo to all network servers,
    the local client uses a g_localTeamPref cvar. The g_localTeamPref
    cvar is cleared after it's used so it doesn't get used when starting
    another server later. Another reason not to use a teampref userinfo
    cvar is there isn't a reliable way to clear it in CGame/UI which are
    likely loaded from baseq3 pk3.

    Make it so g_teamAutoJoin doesn't affect clients who specify
    teampref. If teampref is invalid, the client will join a random team
    like g_teamAutoJoin.

    Don't apply g_teamForceBalance to the local client or bots. Otherwise
    they may be left as spectators when starting team game from menu.

    The start server menus use team command and g_localTeamPref to set
    the human player's team. This way it's compatible with vanilla Q3
    game VMs and the new setting team at connect feature.

    Make 'globalservers 0' fetch all masters

    This commit fixes the vanilla Q3 UI VMs not displaying a server list
    when id Software's master server is down.

    Originally master 0 for the globalservers command was Internet and
    master 1 was MPlayer (defunct). In 2008 ioquake3 changed it so that
    master 0 to 4 were five separate master servers with no affect on
    original Quake3/Team Arena UI VMs; they continued to get the server
    list from master.quake3arena.com.

    id Software's master server (master.quake3arena.com) goes down
    occasionally. Using ioq3's UI VM additional master servers can be
    accessed but players using the original UI VMs are unable to get a
    server list.

    In order to fix the original UI VMs in Quake3/Team Arena's pk3s this
    commit makes 'globalservers 0' fetch all master servers. So players
    get a combined list of id Software's and ioquake3's master list. Or
    just ioquake3's list if id Software's master is down.

    Getting lists from individual master servers using globalservers has
    changed from 0 through 4 to 1 through 5 to accommodate using 0 for
    other purposes. This commit modifies ioq3's UI code to support the new
    values for globalservers command.

    A side affect of these changes is that UI VMs based on ioq3 since 2008
    will have Internet1 fetch all master servers and Internet2 request
    sv_master1 instead of sv_master2 and so on. It may be worth noting that
    getting server list from masters 3-5 could not be done using ioq3's UI
    before 2011.

    integer argument.

    Also the ioquake3 engine remove command separators from client game
    commands in Cmd_Args_Sanitize().

    Make input events use earliest possible time

    SDL doesn't provide exact the exact time that input events happen
    so use the earliest possible time that an event could happen.

    This make sub-frame input actions such as walking take affect
    immediately instead of in the next frame.

    Based on patch by Alexander "wareya" Nadeau.
